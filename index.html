          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
        <h1/>
        <p>
          I am a self-taught developer with an affinity for mathematics and its applications in development.
          I program mainly in Haskell, Rust, and Python.
          I excel at learning and applying design patterns such as Composition, Dependency Injection and Mutability Safety.
